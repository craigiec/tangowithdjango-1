Official report retrieval


Is there a way to find the url directly?

The interesting bit seems to be the r=xxxx, but given that there are other reports in-between meeting of parliament, seems unreliable.

Just go to the official report page, and get the latest url from there?

Only last 3, but seems rather easy.
