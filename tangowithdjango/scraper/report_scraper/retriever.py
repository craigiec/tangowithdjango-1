# Retrieve the data from parliamentary reports
# The concept is simple : find a (new) report, extract the html and give it to the scraper
# The harder part is finding correct URLs for reports
#
# URLs all begin by http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx
# Report then have an id number added after that
# like http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=9566
#
# @input : none
# @output : an xml data file for each report found
# @ assume : URL scheme on the website will stay the same

# To get the HTML
import urllib2
# The scraper

# To store/load the dictionary as json
